# pands-problem-set
This is file documents my solutions each of the ten problems given in the pands-problem-set 2019

Question 1 sumuptp.py
This is a program that prompts for a positive integer and calculates the sum of all the number from 1 to that number, and outputs this number. The program originally took in the value enter by the user and assigned it to a string variable. The next version of this programe prompted the user for a positive integer and assigned the value to an integer variable.

Question 2 begins-with-a-t.py
The ask here was to find out if the current day of the week began with a T. The first thing to do here was to import the days of the week using import datetime function in Python. This assigned integers to each day of the week see table below.

Function Overview:
The weekday() function of date class in datetime module, returns an integer

corresponding to the day of the week.  Here is the mapping of integer values to the days of the week.

Monday = 0
Tuesday = 1
Wednesday = 2
Thursday = 3
Friday = 4
Saturday = 5
Sunday = 6

An if and if else can ask for the two days of the week that begin with t, the final statement print if the 1st two ifs are not true
